# ETF People Blueprint Overview

Brief derived from discovery conversations between Katie Lingley and Anton Christoff (Sep 2024 – May 2025). Crafted for investor-grade review.

## Investment Snapshot
- **Thesis:** Institutional investors need a compliant bridge into blockchain-enabled ETFs; ETF People delivers the operating system while TheGenuine Collective (TGC) engineers the technical core.
- **Target Users:** Asset managers, regulated funds, and capital markets teams building tokenized products.
- **Go-to-Market Edge:** Dual-engine model—ETF People leads market education and commercial acquisition; TGC anchors protocol, infrastructure, and integrations with regulated partners.

## Vision & Objectives
1. Provide a trusted pathway for asset managers to launch and manage tokenized ETFs with end-to-end transparency.
2. Combine education, product orchestration, settlement tooling, and governance automation into a single platform.
3. Reduce perceived risk via best-in-class compliance frameworks, custody blueprints, and TGC-managed security baselines.
4. Establish ETF People as the commercial spearhead and TGC as the technical steward for continued innovation.

## Operating Model Alignment
- **TGC (Technical Core):** Architecture design, protocol engineering, integrations, security audits, data pipelines, and DevOps. Responsible for maintaining a reference implementation that can be licensed or hosted for institutional clients.
- **ETF People (Commercial Engine):** Market research, client onboarding, regulatory liaison, venture partnerships, and revenue strategy. Owns the knowledge portal content, customer success, and GTM motions.
- **Joint Steering:** Bi-weekly roadmap councils, shared compliance review boards, and unified analytics dashboards to balance product velocity with sales feedback.
