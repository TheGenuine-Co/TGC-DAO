# Capital Requirements & Cost Rationale

Two-tier view designed for investor conversations:
- **Prototype Track:** Initial budget to validate market demand with a focused feature set.
- **Full Platform Track:** Funding envelope to build the production-grade solution described in the roadmap.

All figures assume a blended team (strategy, product, design, engineering, compliance). Refine once scope, jurisdictions, and partner contracts are confirmed. TGC leads engineering + security spend; ETF People leads commercial, regulatory, and GTM budgets.

## Prototype Track (Discovery → Pilot)

| Phase | Duration | Cost Range (USD) | Spend Focus | Outcome |
|-------|----------|------------------|-------------|---------|
| 0. Discovery & Strategy | 4–6 weeks | **$25k – $40k** | Strategy lead, analyst, legal desk research | Validated problem statement & investment memo |
| 1. Concept & Experience | 4–6 weeks | **$35k – $55k** | Product/UX duo, light architecture, content outline | Clickable prototypes, prioritised feature backlog |
| 2. Prototype Build & Testing | 8–10 weeks | **$95k – $140k** | Lean engineering pod (2–3 devs), contract engineer for smart contracts, QA | Working prototype (knowledge portal + limited launchpad) |
| 3. Pilot Lite | 4–6 weeks | **$35k – $55k** | Program manager, compliance advisor (part-time), lightweight GTM | Pilot feedback, refined business case, partner interest |

**Prototype Track Total:** **$190k – $290k**

## Full Platform Track (Discovery → Optimisation)

| Phase | Duration | Cost Range (USD) | Primary Spend Buckets | Notes |
|-------|----------|------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| 0. Discovery & Strategy | 4–6 weeks | **$35k – $60k** | Strategy lead, market analyst, legal advisor | Produces investment memo, validated requirements |
| 1. Concept & Experience | 6–8 weeks | **$60k – $90k** | Product lead, UX/UI designer, solution architect, compliance SME | Outputs UX prototypes, architecture, partner brief |
| 2. Build & Integration | 12–16 weeks | **$180k – $260k** | 4-person dev squad, smart contract specialists, QA, DevOps | Delivers portal + launchpad MVP, integrations, security sign-off |
| 3. Pilot & Rollout | 8–10 weeks | **$70k – $110k** | Beta program mgr, support engineer, compliance counsel, marketing | Funds beta operations, legal review, GTM assets |
| 4. Optimisation (per quarter) | ongoing | **$45k – $85k / quarter** | Product manager, engineer, data analyst, compliance retainer | Sustains enhancements, analytics, jurisdiction expansion |

**Full Platform Total (Phases 0–3):** **$345k – $520k** before ongoing optimisation spend.

## Cost Rationale & Breakdown

**Phase 0 — Discovery & Strategy**
- Personnel: strategy lead + research analyst ($28k – $38k prototype / $28k – $38k full).
- Legal/compliance scans: $5k – $12k (full track includes deeper jurisdiction review).
- Workshops & stakeholder incentives: $2k – $4k.

**Phase 1 — Concept & Experience**
- UX/UI + product management: $20k – $30k (prototype) / $28k – $36k (full).
- Architecture + technical scoping: $8k – $12k (prototype) / $15k – $22k (full).
- Content + compliance alignment: $5k – $8k (prototype) / $8k – $12k (full).
- Tooling & contingency: $6k – $10k (prototype) / $9k – $20k (full).

**Phase 2 — Engineering Build**
- Prototype: 2–3 engineers for 2.5 months ($70k – $105k) + contract blockchain specialist ($15k – $25k) + QA ($10k). TGC supplies core engineering capacity; outside spend limited to audits.
- Full Platform: 4-person squad for 3–4 months ($90k – $120k) + blockchain specialists ($35k – $55k) + QA/DevOps ($20k – $30k) + program management ($25k – $37k). Includes external security audits and interoperability research budget.

**Phase 3 — Pilot & Rollout**
- Prototype (lite pilot): program manager ($15k – $20k), compliance advisor ($8k – $12k), lightweight GTM ($8k – $15k), incentives/tools ($4k – $8k). ETF People manages client touchpoints; TGC provides technical support and instrumentation.
- Full launch: program & support ($28k – $36k), compliance/legal ($12k – $20k), GTM assets ($15k – $28k), incentives/tools ($15k – $26k). Includes budget for regulator workshops and co-marketing with partners.

**Phase 4 — Optimisation (Full Platform only)**
- Ongoing product/engineering coverage: $25k – $45k per quarter.
- Data/analytics & growth experiments: $8k – $15k per quarter.
- Compliance retainer/audits: $6k – $12k per quarter.
- Infrastructure & contingency: $6k – $13k per quarter.

## Additional Investment Considerations
- **Partner Fees:** Specialist blockchain or compliance partners may request retainers or revenue share. Prototype track assumes limited commitments.
- **Jurisdiction Expansion:** $25k – $50k per region for legal filings and localisation when scaling beyond pilot markets.
- **Infrastructure Scaling:** Budget $5k – $10k per month post-launch for hosting, nodes, monitoring, and security tools.
- **Marketing Sprints:** Reserve $15k+ per major campaign (conferences, executive dinners, thought leadership) once GTM begins.
- **Self-Build Levers:** Reuse TGC’s Fabrica components (quantum kernel, registry, braid engine) to reduce build spend; deploy on cloud credits & managed nodes during prototype phase to conserve cash.
- **Contingency Planning:** Maintain 10–15% contingency for regulatory delays, additional audits, or partner integration overruns.

> Use prototype costs to de-risk with a narrower scope. Invest in the full platform track once market fit and partner alignment are validated.
