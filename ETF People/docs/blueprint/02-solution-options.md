# Solution Concepts & Enablers

Solution pillars designed to de-risk investment decisions and accelerate institutional adoption.

## 1. Knowledge & Readiness Portal
- **Value Proposition:** Convert education gaps into qualified leads ready to enter product design.
- **Key Modules:** Executive briefings, regulatory heat map, tokenization ROI calculators, readiness assessments, booking for experts, and sandbox diaries tracking regulatory updates.
- **Revenue Levers:** Subscription access for teams, sponsored masterclasses, premium advisory upsells.
- **Build Notes:** Requires content operations, compliance review workflows, analytics, CRM integration. TGC supplies data ingestion + personalization engine; ETF People manages editorial calendar and partner contributions.
- **Best Practice Hooks:** Include comparison matrices of tokenization archetypes, maturity assessments (people/process/tech), and guided “design sprints” to convert interest into scoped engagements.

## 2. Tokenized ETF Launchpad
- **Value Proposition:** A guided workflow that takes an ETF concept from whiteboard to compliant issuance.
- **Core Components:**
  - Product design wizard (mandate, asset mix, risk disclosures).
  - Smart contract template library validated by accredited engineering partners.
  - Integration layer for tokenization/issuance APIs and regulatory reporting.
  - Governance hooks into the respective validator workflow.
- **Monetisation:** Platform fees per launch, success fees on assets under management, white-labeled deployments, and API access for third-party administrators.
- **Implementation Notes:**
  - TGC develops modular smart contract kits aligned with ERC-1400/1155 and local digital security standards.
  - Embed lifecycle states (draft → compliance review → issuance → secondary market) with audit trails stored in the respective technical registry.
  - Provide “self-service” and “co-build” modes—self-service for digital-native managers, co-build for institutional teams requiring concierge support.
- **External Integrations:** On/off-ramp providers, custodians, compliance APIs, and secondary trading venues. Maintain pluggable architecture so ETF People can tailor providers per jurisdiction.

## 3. Interoperability & Settlement Layer
- **Value Proposition:** Institutional-grade bridge and settlement orchestration that satisfies T+1 mandates.
- **Delivery Approach:**
  - Managed bridge-as-a-service with policy and compliance controls.
  - Optional dedicated rollup/appchain for high-value settlement flows.
  - Custodian connectors and reconciliation dashboards.
- **Strategic Outcome:** Positions ETF People as the “operating hub” connecting legacy systems with on-chain liquidity.
- **Design Principles:**
  - Separation of concerns between messaging, asset custody, and compliance checks.
  - Support for cross-chain proofs (e.g., light clients or optimistic verification) to satisfy audit requirements.
  - Provide integration adapters for SWIFT, ISO 20022, and existing fund administration systems so ETF People can sell into traditional stacks.
- **Potential Providers:** Evaluate institutional bridge vendors, Layer-2 settlement frameworks, and permissioned blockchain consortia for partnerships or white-label agreements.

## 4. Compliance, Custody & Risk Framework

  - Policy templates covering AML/KYC, investor onboarding, reporting cadence.
- **Commercial Tie-ins:** Retainer packages for ongoing compliance management and audits.
- **Execution Detail:**

  - Publish attestation schedule (SOC2, ISO 27001, smart contract audits) and maintain evidence repository accessible to clients.
  - Offer “compliance as configuration”: toggleable policy packs by jurisdiction with associated reporting templates.

## 5. Partner Ecosystem & Co-Build Program
- **Value Proposition:** Curated bench of engineering, legal, and market specialists to accelerate delivery.
- **Actions:**
  - Define partner evaluation scorecard (domain expertise, regulatory coverage, delivery speed).
  - Launch co-marketing initiatives (webinars, case studies) to build market credibility.
  - Negotiate revenue-share or referral models for joint engagements.
- **Partner Archetypes:**
  - Regulatory & legal advisors familiar with digital securities regimes.

  - Distribution partners (wealth platforms, institutional brokers) to extend ETF People’s reach.
- **Governance:** Establish partner tiers (strategic, preferred, certified) with clear SLAs, integration requirements, and joint GTM plans.

## Product Governance & Feedback Loop
