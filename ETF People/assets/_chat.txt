[10/09/2024, 14:07:57] Katie Lingley: Hi Anton
I’ve just tried to call you so feel free to return the call when you have a moment.
Many thanks

[12/09/2024, 14:46:25] Anton Christoff: Hi Katie
[12/09/2024, 14:46:39] Anton Christoff: I’ve been kicked out from the meeting for some weird reason
[12/09/2024, 14:47:00] Anton Christoff: And I could not get back in
[12/09/2024, 14:47:06] Katie Lingley: Sorry I’ve sent you a new link
[12/09/2024, 14:47:13] Katie Lingley: On LinkedIn

[14/09/2024, 15:56:56] Anton Christoff: It’s great that the industry has started to openly sharing the benefits of doing things better, and blockchain as underlying infrastructure enhancement tech would surely revolutionise the industry in way forward

[22/11/2024, 12:58:44] Anton Christoff: FYI

https://ethereumadoption.com/
[22/11/2024, 13:12:32] Katie Lingley: It’s all happening!
[22/11/2024, 13:13:28] Anton Christoff: this is the company that makes things happen for BlackRock in this space:
[22/11/2024, 13:13:29] Anton Christoff: https://securitize.io
[22/11/2024, 13:16:15] Anton Christoff: this article gives a nice intro perspective on the matter of tokenisation:
[22/11/2024, 13:16:17] Anton Christoff: https://4irelabs.com/articles/real-world-asset-tokenization/
[22/11/2024, 13:17:53] Anton Christoff: and these are some interesting examples on companies that operate in this space:
[22/11/2024, 13:17:55] Anton Christoff: https://tzero.com/trading/
[22/11/2024, 13:18:03] Anton Christoff: https://swarm.com
[22/11/2024, 13:18:31] Anton Christoff: https://assets.backed.fi
[22/11/2024, 13:40:29] Katie Lingley: Are you still working for R3?
[22/11/2024, 13:43:38] Katie Lingley: Yeah some great capital markets solutions coming to the fore, what are your thoughts on bridging?
[22/11/2024, 13:47:50] Anton Christoff: people that I knew left, and on the back of this all their efforts in the startup space where I was mentoring went quiet
[22/11/2024, 13:49:16] Anton Christoff: but overall I did not see anything meaningful happening as real-life cases to be honest - they seems to have placed most of their focus and effort on the CBDC topic
[22/11/2024, 13:49:34] Anton Christoff: that’s the sensible way forward I think
[22/11/2024, 13:49:56] Anton Christoff: as you need to have a way to transfer assets from one place (network) to another
[22/11/2024, 13:51:29] Anton Christoff: currently everything is not that streamlined yet as it requires one-to-one bridging, but I’m sure there would be a much more standardised model established on way forward
[22/11/2024, 14:04:07] Katie Lingley: Yes for sure, T+1 settlement too
[22/11/2024, 14:04:45] Katie Lingley: Systems vs tokenisation would be all encompassing
[16/01/2025, 12:41:11] Anton Christoff: Happy New Year Katie! All the best for a better and prosperous 2025 to you and your loved ones!
[16/01/2025, 12:42:24] Anton Christoff: I have found a blockchain tech company interested to collaborate in the etf opportunity we have discussed
[16/01/2025, 12:54:16] Anton Christoff: It’s called Nethermind and they are both one of the best on the market, but also one of the most reputable in the Ethereum space
[16/01/2025, 12:54:55] Anton Christoff: Already talked with their founder last week and we are due to organise further meeting with him and team to discuss the opportunity
[16/01/2025, 12:55:38] Anton Christoff: But initial feedback is they’re both interested and also having expertise to build such products
[16/01/2025, 12:57:08] Katie Lingley: Hi Anton, same to you and wishing you only the best for 2025!
[16/01/2025, 12:58:27] Katie Lingley: Looks great, would love to know more so should we set up a call first before we schedule with them?
[16/01/2025, 12:59:09] Anton Christoff: Yes please
[16/01/2025, 12:59:28] Katie Lingley: When are you free?
[16/01/2025, 12:59:31] Anton Christoff: As it’d be great if the two of us could come up with a plan of what’s next as steps
[16/01/2025, 12:59:47] Katie Lingley: Yes definitely, let’s reverse engineer
[16/01/2025, 13:00:00] Anton Christoff: Tommorow I’m flexible, as for the next couple of days
[16/01/2025, 13:00:28] Katie Lingley: Let me check
[16/01/2025, 13:00:37] Anton Christoff: They are pure techies and it would be good if we can draw a roadmap for them what would be needed, etc
[16/01/2025, 13:02:37] Anton Christoff: Just gave them the basic context now - what if we build a portal where asset managers could visit, learn the basics about blockchain stuff and also get an idea how and where to start their journey on building a blockchain etf ‎<This message was edited>
[16/01/2025, 13:03:47] Katie Lingley: That sounds good 👌
[16/01/2025, 13:08:50] Anton Christoff: Their major concern is the traditional stuff, which I told them you’re well equipped to cover, so it potentially looks like a match in heaven :)
[16/01/2025, 13:09:27] Katie Lingley: Let’s hope so 🤞
[16/01/2025, 13:10:50] Anton Christoff: There is plenty of fish in this sea, but decided to approach first peers that I well know and have been working with.
Otherwise, we could always approach other ventures which would surely be interested to monetise on this
[16/01/2025, 13:11:59] Katie Lingley: Eastern Europe is a developing ETF region so this fits in well
[16/01/2025, 13:12:12] Anton Christoff: Nethermind’s founder has previously worked in the banking space for City, doing financial products
[16/01/2025, 13:12:24] Anton Christoff: Nethermind is a global company
[16/01/2025, 13:12:31] Anton Christoff: Registered here in the U.K.
[16/01/2025, 13:12:42] Katie Lingley: Great, I still wonder why R3 hasn’t been more successful
[16/01/2025, 13:12:55] Katie Lingley: Yes but predominantly staff based in EE
[16/01/2025, 13:13:18] Anton Christoff: They embrace remote culture and most of their employees are spread across the globe, including EE as founder is polish
[16/01/2025, 13:13:39] Anton Christoff: Ego
[16/01/2025, 13:14:31] Anton Christoff: They don’t want o build products but rather focusing on spreading their overall network and asking clients to build products for them
[16/01/2025, 13:15:17] Anton Christoff: My closest peers there have left the company which isn’t a good sign
[16/01/2025, 13:15:23] Katie Lingley: Spot on, I sensed that
[16/01/2025, 13:15:47] Anton Christoff: Too cocky in the not so good old fashioned way
[16/01/2025, 13:16:18] Katie Lingley: It’s a team effort nobody is God
[16/01/2025, 13:17:20] Anton Christoff: That’s the main issue, as most of these chaps what to reinvent the wheel just by themselves and not willing to collaborate in the real terms of the word
[16/01/2025, 13:19:55] Katie Lingley: They will stay outsiders
[16/01/2025, 13:25:48] Katie Lingley: Does Monday work?
[16/01/2025, 13:51:43] Anton Christoff: yes, if it is possily after 10am as I’m doing the school run in the morning
[16/01/2025, 13:57:53] Katie Lingley: Sure I’m travelling atm so 2+ hours ahead of UK
[20/01/2025, 11:01:16] Anton Christoff: Good morning Katie. Hope you had a good weekend.
Are we still having our catch up today?
[20/01/2025, 11:04:30] Katie Lingley: Morning Anton, yes we are
[20/01/2025, 11:05:14] Anton Christoff: Great! Let me know what time would be best for you, as you did mention you’d be travelling
[20/01/2025, 11:20:36] Katie Lingley: I sent you the meeting invite, think you accepted?
[20/01/2025, 11:21:55] Anton Christoff: You have just sent me an email with the nda’s and said that 12 works, but did not receive an invite afterwards
[20/01/2025, 11:24:08] Katie Lingley: You accepted a 2pm Zoom invite
[20/01/2025, 11:27:34] Anton Christoff: Oh did I - sorry Katie, will look into my calendars as today there’s something weird going on with my phone notifications and updates
[20/01/2025, 11:27:50] Anton Christoff: Speak then and apologies
[20/01/2025, 11:29:37] Anton Christoff: Yes, it did pop up on my phone calendar - 2pm U.K. time

‎[06/02/2025, 14:07:06] Anton Christoff: ‎image omitted
[06/02/2025, 14:17:07] Katie Lingley: Hi Anton, not off the top of my head but can let you know
[06/02/2025, 14:17:22] Katie Lingley: What are your thoughts on Deepseek?
[06/02/2025, 14:32:07] Anton Christoff: Thank you Katie
[06/02/2025, 14:34:03] Anton Christoff: Tbh, I was expecting China to hit back on Taiwan, but was thinking more about some military actions, similar to their comrades in Russia. Anyways this is all great as it would brake further the foundation of the status quo and will spark greater innovation
[06/02/2025, 14:35:55] Anton Christoff: Nvidia model isn’t sustainable
[06/02/2025, 14:36:57] Anton Christoff: And there wasn’t the butcojn  mining case nothing like this would have happened
[06/02/2025, 14:38:02] Anton Christoff: Graphic processors are not designed by default to act as main processors
[06/02/2025, 14:38:29] Anton Christoff: And the CPU industry will strike back even sooner than expected
[06/02/2025, 14:39:04] Katie Lingley: Interesting, how so?
[06/02/2025, 14:40:26] Anton Christoff: Deepseek just exposed the fugazzi element behind overvaluing stuff just to “scale” things in terms of economic value
[06/02/2025, 14:40:47] Anton Christoff: It’s the basics of electronics and computer science
[06/02/2025, 14:41:47] Anton Christoff: The graphic/video cards are meant to support the CPU in doing computations to when it comes to visualising quickly stuff
[06/02/2025, 14:43:22] Anton Christoff: The Bitcoin miners found a way 10-12 years ago to booster the processing power by shifting the way computation works
[06/02/2025, 14:44:23] Katie Lingley: Sounds like we need another catchup!
[06/02/2025, 14:44:50] Anton Christoff: It’s all math which I hate but was quite good with it
[06/02/2025, 14:46:40] Anton Christoff: I have finished college in electronics and computer science before my nuclear engineering bsc
[06/02/2025, 14:47:09] Anton Christoff: It’s all stupid algorithms
[06/02/2025, 14:49:16] Anton Christoff: And whilst the CPU industry (Intel, AMD, etc) were focused on making more powerful processors, which can do gazzion calculations, nvidia (thanks to gaming and btc mining) has focused on how to make calculations quicker
[06/02/2025, 14:49:30] Anton Christoff: Which gave them the edge
[06/02/2025, 14:50:03] Katie Lingley: Super interesting
[06/02/2025, 14:50:19] Anton Christoff: So rather than making the equation more complex, the entire math turned into how to solve it quicker
[06/02/2025, 14:52:02] Anton Christoff: By simplifying it into more but simpler equations
[06/02/2025, 14:54:38] Anton Christoff: And since graphic visualisation is one of the most complex math exercises out there, nvidia suddenly went into space
[06/02/2025, 14:55:14] Anton Christoff: By finding a way to compute stuff quicker than the CPU
[06/02/2025, 14:56:40] Anton Christoff: Let’s book a catch up when you’re available, as we anyway have to come up with some sort of a plan and task list to nethermind
[06/02/2025, 15:04:42] Katie Lingley: Absolutely 👌
[06/02/2025, 15:05:23] Katie Lingley: Am travelling next week but will be brainstorming further and send you some ideas
[06/02/2025, 15:20:55] Anton Christoff: Great! Let me know when you  are settled to have the call
[06/02/2025, 15:22:07] Anton Christoff: As for cpu and gpu - the simplest way to describe it is that cpu is trying to sort things out fast, whilst the gpu focuses on doing similar things quick ‎<This message was edited>
[06/02/2025, 15:24:00] Anton Christoff: And deepseek in a way showcased that we have more or less enough computing power to do both at much lower cost - because cpu power and infrastructure is the core (brain) of it all, and you don’t have to necessarily rely on the expensive stuff as only solution
[06/02/2025, 15:24:59] Anton Christoff: Being predominantly provided only by nvidia
[06/02/2025, 15:26:47] Anton Christoff: That’s why nvidia skyrocketed as the game in both crypto mining and ai is who will finish the task quicker
[06/02/2025, 16:03:16] Katie Lingley: 100% pure automation
[06/02/2025, 16:05:31] Anton Christoff: Gaming as well had an influence due to pandemic and not only as industry is getting bigger and bigger with all things gamification
[06/02/2025, 16:20:47] Katie Lingley: Correct and cryptography too

https://www.linkedin.com/company/twinstake/
[16/05/2025, 14:03:31] Anton Christoff: And we have embarked on the very same old journey to start doing things first from offshore locations

Hope you’re well otherwise, and still up to disrupt the fancy old suits in the etf space

https://blockchaintechnology-news.com/news/maldives-plans-8-billion-blockchain-hub-to-diversify-economy/
[16/05/2025, 14:11:58] Katie Lingley: Hi Anton, sorry for the radio silence. A few life issues got in the way! I’m definitely still keen and been thinking about this more today. There is a huge focus on Capital Markets now in each region and getting regulated blockchain solutions in play. The big question is always, who holds the money. Would they feel comfortable with an offshore location or pure blockchain based technology being their treasury.  It’s a mindset change that no-one has the answers for as no guarantees of security. Have you looked at the company 21Shares, it was started by engineers who disrupted the asset management industry with their blockchain solutions.
[16/05/2025, 18:18:21] Anton Christoff: Nethermind know 21shares solution when I spoke to their now ex CEO
[16/05/2025, 18:18:34] Anton Christoff: We have more than capable tech team to deliver
[16/05/2025, 18:19:12] Anton Christoff: Not to mention that Nethermind’s ex ceo now became the co-exec director of Ethereum foundation
[16/05/2025, 18:19:46] Anton Christoff: Holding capital always can be in cold storage if it’s not necessarily tradeable
[16/05/2025, 18:20:01] Anton Christoff: We should talk again soon
[16/05/2025, 18:20:21] Anton Christoff: Hope everything is well and let me know when you can chat
[16/05/2025, 18:23:24] Katie Lingley: I think because “we” (ie in the regulated space) usually work with physically backed securities this it is a step away from that into the digital space which needs to be linked to a heavily regulated treasury so I’m trying to figure out how to do that
[16/05/2025, 18:23:38] Katie Lingley: Absolutely I don’t doubt you
[16/05/2025, 18:24:40] Katie Lingley: May not be favourable as a secure storage solution but I need to understand how this works with RWA now in play
[16/05/2025, 18:24:56] Katie Lingley: Yes are you still in London?
[16/05/2025, 22:11:40] Anton Christoff: Swiss I think should offer such infrastructure
[16/05/2025, 22:12:09] Anton Christoff: Yes, I’m here
[16/05/2025, 22:34:58] Katie Lingley: That’s where 21Shares began
[16/05/2025, 22:35:11] Katie Lingley: Great, let’s chat this week 👌
[20/05/2025, 20:05:15] Anton Christoff: https://cryptocrunchapp.com/cryptocrunchnews/latest-kraken-launches-regulated-crypto-derivatives-in-europe/
[20/05/2025, 20:13:30] Katie Lingley: Are you free on Thurs or Fri?
[21/05/2025, 11:05:30] Katie Lingley: www.centrifuge.io
[21/05/2025, 11:11:23] Anton Christoff: There’s plenty of solutions like this one
[21/05/2025, 11:11:34] Anton Christoff: That’s what soaked the so called defi
[21/05/2025, 11:12:16] Anton Christoff: Couple of years ago and triggered the institutional interest towards bitcoin and crypto
[21/05/2025, 11:13:28] Anton Christoff: Traditional finance is still pretty much oblivious on the amount of new money being printed legitimately, only in this big but still small use case side of this industry
[21/05/2025, 11:14:09] Anton Christoff: If I’m right in the next couple of months crypto will go bonkers until autumn
[21/05/2025, 11:14:57] Anton Christoff: Btc ~200k
Etc ~ 10k
Altcoins and shitcoins 5/10/15x rise at least
[21/05/2025, 11:17:18] Anton Christoff: Then the balloon would pop up again as it used to, from end of this year until end of next/beginning of following one to levels of btc ~50/60k (last ath level), and rest close to nothing :) and then again clump up for two years with a new ath around autumn 2029
[21/05/2025, 11:18:23] Anton Christoff: I’ve seen this with my own eyes since 2016/2017 when I started hustling blockchain tech in KPMG
[21/05/2025, 11:30:34] Katie Lingley: Who else is tokenizing RWA?
[21/05/2025, 11:30:46] Katie Lingley: Thought this was a new trend
[21/05/2025, 11:31:25] Katie Lingley: Probably right and they’re ignoring it as they will become obsolete
[21/05/2025, 11:31:54] Katie Lingley: I’m not down that rabbit hole just yet
[21/05/2025, 11:32:06] Katie Lingley: ETC thought was doing better
[21/05/2025, 11:32:25] Katie Lingley: You’re the guru 👌
[21/05/2025, 12:12:13] Anton Christoff: Have to look at current market as companies pop up and out regularly in the space as you can imagine :)
[21/05/2025, 12:13:02] Anton Christoff: But this is the future for all things traditional finance and fintech FULL STOP :)
[21/05/2025, 12:13:26] Anton Christoff: And more and more solutions are shaping up each and every day
[21/05/2025, 12:14:12] Anton Christoff: Don’t have to be - just giving you an overview on how all things crypto are moving through the Bitcoin’s 4years cycles thus far ‎<This message was edited>
[21/05/2025, 12:16:05] Anton Christoff: ETH sorry - etc is the old version which is still out there hanging :o) - is not mean to be ridiculously expensive as it’s a pure utility token which fuels a network
[21/05/2025, 12:18:21] Anton Christoff: Having said that, with all its struggles of scaling and efficiency through the years, all these level one networks popped up, which created a route for ETH to start creating higher value, as you can distribute lesser tokens when interacting, and you would anyway have the level one token operating on the upper level
[21/05/2025, 12:19:06] Anton Christoff: Which means that ETH could easily go to 10 and why not even 15k, if BTC go nuts at above the 200k level
[21/05/2025, 12:19:26] Anton Christoff: But the interesting stuff would happens from next year onwards
[21/05/2025, 12:19:44] Katie Lingley: It’s very new and only just now hit UK, although no platform in UK supports it as not yet regulated
[21/05/2025, 12:20:04] Katie Lingley: Yip but pricing issues
[21/05/2025, 12:20:26] Katie Lingley: Sounds promising
[21/05/2025, 12:21:04] Katie Lingley: Sorry meant ETH too, thought it was taking over BTC
[21/05/2025, 12:21:08] Anton Christoff: As value would start dropping, which makes things much easier from (I) cost perspective (as when all things are in red it’s much cheaper to build), and (II) from pure profit perspective as you can start generating whilst it’s at much lower levels and wait for the 4year cycle to end to monetise
[21/05/2025, 12:21:29] Katie Lingley: I see
[21/05/2025, 12:21:33] Anton Christoff: It is suppose to take over any moment now in terms of volume and dominance
[21/05/2025, 12:21:48] Anton Christoff: Which would have to trigger the so called Altcoins season
[21/05/2025, 12:22:17] Anton Christoff: From the look of the market right now we are very much right at the start of this charade :)))
[21/05/2025, 12:26:34] Anton Christoff: It always started before with BTC marking new ath - let’s say by the end of this or beginning of next it would hit perhaps levels ~115k and then there should be a sudden massive drop at price to very much the levels where we are now ~105k in terms of scale, which would supposedly trigger significant  money flows into ETH and rest of coins that would cause them to rise 5-10-15-20-25x for the next more or less two/three months tops
[21/05/2025, 12:27:53] Anton Christoff: I’ve been watching this too closely since 2017, and thus far history repeat itself each and every time, so let’s see if it will happen again for a 4th consecutive one :)
[21/05/2025, 12:29:03] Anton Christoff: If this repeats again, then I would have the golden formula on how you can feasibly start generating 3-10x profit from this market each and very 4 years
[21/05/2025, 12:30:25] Anton Christoff: Which is quite a valuable insight as nothing else out there really makes that roi
[21/05/2025, 12:30:44] Anton Christoff: We could even shape this into a fund structure
[21/05/2025, 12:30:54] Anton Christoff: 🥸🤓😎
[21/05/2025, 12:31:11] Anton Christoff: Private investment one
[21/05/2025, 12:31:54] Anton Christoff: Bernie Madoff scheme but a real one, not ponzi 😂
[21/05/2025, 12:33:34] Anton Christoff: Eveything properly done in this space from now on would be the norm for future solutions ‎<This message was edited>
[21/05/2025, 12:44:02] Katie Lingley: Maybe we submit a POC to the regulators?
[21/05/2025, 12:44:31] Katie Lingley: Do you think people feel safer in a regulated environment?
[21/05/2025, 12:49:36] Katie Lingley: I’ve just asked AI to see if there’s a general ideology…
[21/05/2025, 12:50:04] Katie Lingley: The idea of a recurring 4-year Bitcoin cycle tied to halving events and subsequent altcoin surges is a widely discussed theory in crypto markets. Let’s analyze its validity based on current data and historical patterns:

---

### **1. Bitcoin’s 4-Year Cycle: Structure and Current Phase**
- **Halving-Driven Supply Dynamics**: Bitcoin’s 4-year cycle is historically tied to its halving events, which reduce miner rewards by 50% every ~4 years, constricting new supply. The latest halving occurred in April 2024, and past cycles suggest a bull market typically peaks 12–18 months post-halving, around October 2025 .  
- **Cycle Phases**:  
  - **Accumulation**: Prices stabilize near lows (e.g., $15k in 2022).  
  - **Growth**: Prices rise toward previous ATHs (~$69k in 2021).  
  - **Bubble**: Exponential price surge to new ATHs (e.g., $108k in January 2025) .  
  - **Crash**: Sharp corrections (historically ~80% drawdowns) .  
- **Current Status**: Bitcoin reached ~$108k in January 2025, aligning with predictions of a post-halving ATH. However, its post-halving rally has been slower (+30% since April 2024 vs. past surges of 100%+), suggesting maturing markets and institutional influence .

---

### **2. Altcoin Season ("Altseason") and ETH’s Role**
- **Historical Pattern**: After Bitcoin peaks, capital often flows into altcoins like Ethereum, which historically outperformed BTC by 8:1 during the 2021 altseason .  
- **ETH/BTC Ratio**: The ETH/BTC ratio recently hit multi-year lows (~0.019), a signal that has preceded ETH rallies. Analysts like Steno Research predict ETH could reach $8,000 (2.3x from current ~$3,400) in 2025, with the ETH/BTC ratio rising to 0.06 .  
- **Challenges for Altcoins**:  
  - Ethereum faces headwinds like stagnant network activity, reduced fee burns post-Dencun upgrade, and competition from Solana .  
  - Institutional demand for ETH is weakening, with declining staked ETH and ETF balances .  

---

### **3. Key Risks to the Cycle Theory**  
- **Changing Market Dynamics**:  
  - **Institutional Adoption**: Bitcoin ETFs and regulatory clarity (e.g., Trump’s pro-crypto policies) may decouple BTC from its historical cycle, reducing volatility .  
  - **Miner Behavior**: Post-2024, miners held BTC instead of selling, altering supply dynamics .  
- **Macro Factors**: Rising U.S. Treasury yields and geopolitical tensions could suppress risk assets like crypto .  
- **Cycle Skepticism**: Some analysts argue the 4-year cycle is outdated due to market maturity, though BTC’s 2025 ATH suggests remnants of the pattern persist .

---

### **4. Profitability Scenarios**  
- **BTC’s Projected Peak**: If BTC follows historical trends, it could reach $150k–$250k by late 2025 . A drop to ~$105k afterward (as you hypothesize) would align with typical post-peak corrections (~30% drawdown).  
- **Altcoin Surge**:  
  - **ETH**: A rally to $8k–$12k (2.3x–3.5x) is plausible if DeFi adoption accelerates and ETF inflows rebound .  
  - **High-Risk Alts**: Meme coins or niche projects (e.g., AI/DeFi tokens) could see 5x–25x gains in a speculative frenzy, but these are highly volatile and risky .  

---

### **5. Conclusion: A Modified Cycle?**  
While the 4-year cycle framework remains relevant, its predictability is diminishing. Key takeaways:  
1. **BTC’s Role**: Bitcoin remains the cycle anchor, but its post-halving performance is less explosive than in prior cycles.  
2. **Altseason Timing**: ETH and altcoins may rally post-BTC peak, but structural challenges (e.g., Ethereum’s scalability issues) could dampen returns.  
3. **Risk Management**: The "golden formula" of 3x–10x gains every 4 years is feasible but requires timing the market accurately—a notoriously difficult task. Diversification and monitoring on-chain metrics (e.g., staking ratios, L2 activity) are critical .

[21/05/2025, 12:52:12] Katie Lingley: Those in the traditional space either love or hate Crypto, 2 sides of the fence so it’s a bit risky leading with that only
[21/05/2025, 12:53:05] Katie Lingley: Something more general like “blockchain” or “tokenization”are more digestible ‎<This message was edited>
[21/05/2025, 13:27:33] Anton Christoff: I think there has been plenty of similar activities as FCA for example is having a blockchain sand box for more than 7 years now
[21/05/2025, 13:28:16] Anton Christoff: But this is I guess always one of the initial steps to be taken before going live ‎<This message was edited>
[21/05/2025, 13:31:23] Anton Christoff: You shape something as a concept in more or less a quick and dirty way but clear enough for the regulator to get it, and then you knock on their door with it and ask them for review, comments, recommendations, etc. towards potentially approving this product for being rolled out in the particular jurisdiction ‎<This message was edited>
[21/05/2025, 15:09:33] Katie Lingley: Perhaps we do that then
[21/05/2025, 15:11:17] Katie Lingley: If we are running a platform, it doesn’t need to be formally regulated but the product would be
[21/05/2025, 15:13:26] Katie Lingley: Maybe a platform overlay for self-created financial products on ETH, as we mentioned before
[21/05/2025, 15:28:42] Anton Christoff: We have a way to do rest of blockchains either, but ETH based ones I think would prevail over the rest
[21/05/2025, 15:29:02] Katie Lingley: We can be blockchain agnostic
[21/05/2025, 15:29:53] Katie Lingley: I think there are guys in the ETF space who already do this but we can decide on type of products to offer
[21/05/2025, 15:30:13] Katie Lingley: I think gradually ETFs may be phased out
[21/05/2025, 15:30:58] Katie Lingley: So we would need to think of what the next gen would like to invest in which they can customise themselves ie social causes etc
[21/05/2025, 15:31:25] Katie Lingley: Maybe like a crowdfunding model but better??
[21/05/2025, 15:38:32] Anton Christoff: We can start from what’s already available and on a step by step approach to expand this into a proper tokenisation platform
[21/05/2025, 15:40:24] Anton Christoff: Not sure about that, considering that one of the best techies in that space has become a co-exec. And moreover with all top layers that have been build and running on top of it with possibilities to integrate with btc and other networks
[21/05/2025, 15:42:19] Anton Christoff: That’s another reason why I got also interested in your reach, as I do have a similar idea which I’ve tried to roll out unsuccessfully as a next gen crowdfunding platform couple of years ago due to techies, but still very much looking into
[21/05/2025, 15:43:41] Anton Christoff: Will share throughs when we speak, but in a similar fashion we should definitely look into this from “an enterprise/corporate” level
[21/05/2025, 15:46:44] Katie Lingley: Yes a winning first product to market and then expand the range
[21/05/2025, 15:47:18] Katie Lingley: I mean ETF not ETH 😂
[21/05/2025, 15:47:52] Katie Lingley: Oh wow, how far did you get?
[21/05/2025, 15:49:11] Katie Lingley: The traditional institutional model and banks are dying although yes I know pension fund rules are very strict, the way things are moving in Europe are becoming retail focused rather than institutional
[21/05/2025, 19:27:10] Anton Christoff: Ready to roll and the tech team overpromised and underdelivered despite being paid in full… then the classic tech blackmailing of: we need another X to finish, despite saying we will do it for Y which you’ve paid, and we are not going to give you the code until you pay 🤠 classic case… told them to go and F themselves with the code and to have a good life 😂
[21/05/2025, 19:28:02] Anton Christoff: That sounds even better as retail are much more “future-ready” and “open minded” for new investment products
[21/05/2025, 19:29:26] Anton Christoff: That makes sense as I still do not get them really 🫣
[21/05/2025, 19:51:30] Katie Lingley: Oh gosh, typical! How do you think we should work with the Nethermind guys? ‎<This message was edited>
[21/05/2025, 19:52:28] Katie Lingley: Exactly but the insti guys are now building product for retail, which are not always products they they believe in
[21/05/2025, 19:53:01] Katie Lingley: I will say the same about your field of expertise 😊
[21/05/2025, 19:53:56] Anton Christoff: I think the framework you proposed some time ago should be compelling
[21/05/2025, 19:54:22] Anton Christoff: ‎You deleted this message.
[21/05/2025, 19:54:23] Anton Christoff: ‎You deleted this message.
[21/05/2025, 19:55:24] Anton Christoff: Perfect synergy
[21/05/2025, 20:07:23] Katie Lingley: Retainer + % of AUM ?
[21/05/2025, 20:08:21] Katie Lingley: Or being a tech platform should we not get a % of licence fee or users?
[21/05/2025, 20:08:38] Katie Lingley: What time you free tomorrow?
[21/05/2025, 20:15:40] Anton Christoff: Something like that yes
[21/05/2025, 20:16:03] Anton Christoff: Definitely things like that should also be considered
[21/05/2025, 20:17:00] Anton Christoff: A win-win joint venture should be possible I think
[21/05/2025, 20:17:45] Anton Christoff: Where equally both side could benefit from both products and projects side
[21/05/2025, 20:19:10] Katie Lingley: Difficult to quantify as a start up
[21/05/2025, 20:19:30] Katie Lingley: But yes both benefit
[21/05/2025, 20:19:55] Anton Christoff: That should be the goal, otherwise should be a no go
[21/05/2025, 20:20:02] Katie Lingley: Am heading to bed been a long day, afternoon ok?
[21/05/2025, 20:20:19] Anton Christoff: Have a good night ‎<This message was edited>
[21/05/2025, 20:20:31] Anton Christoff: Yes, I have some things happening but could find the time
[21/05/2025, 20:20:44] Katie Lingley: Let me know what works
[21/05/2025, 20:20:55] Anton Christoff: Ping me when you have availability
[21/05/2025, 20:21:03] Anton Christoff: As I could move things around
[22/05/2025, 14:48:43] Katie Lingley: Sorry I’ve now been pulled into something else today, will ping you
[22/05/2025, 14:51:45] Anton Christoff: No worries, let’s speak tomorrow if better for you

[25/06/2025, 22:51:33] Anton Christoff: Hey, hope you are well. Sorry for the late message but days are hectic.
From the look of the market thus far, at the end of this year every single FS entity would want to jump in, and it’s be good to span out at least a quick and dirty version of what we are aiming to achieve.
I do have cleared a lot of time in my diary on way forward for much more blockchain related work, as I have also re-enabled my startup initiative, and it’d be great to potentially get going in our initiative either.
I’m completely capable to back you up on the tech/business/solutions/propositions/products part and you’d be the spearhead.
Let me know when you are ok to chat further, as we’d need at least a couple of get togethers to draw a prototype blueprint
[27/06/2025, 10:29:48] Katie Lingley: Morning Anton, thanks for the message. I’ve been trying to get my head around the technicalities so that I can explain to you what is needed. 
I think it’s a new “value layer” which needs to be built on top of a blockchain “base layer”. I have sourced the provider for the “base layer” already, but need to develop the technology to add onto this and integrate with the existing “traditional” ecosystem. Trying to see how much it would cost too, would you be able to give me a quote on this? Think also maybe I need to spend a week emerged in your blockchain space in order to understand it perhaps. Happy to chat, when you have a gap.
[27/06/2025, 14:15:31] Anton Christoff: Let’s organise a chat and start getting things into the right place step by step
[27/06/2025, 14:26:08] Katie Lingley: I don’t think there’s a blueprint for this, R3 has done some aspects of the work but not exactly what I’m thinking of, it would need to be fairly low cost but I suppose some form of partnerships along the way. Maybe the Ether guys would sponsor or fund some of the work? Are you free on Monday?
[27/06/2025, 14:32:50] Anton Christoff: Would not count on r3 but rather follow the trend with ethereum
[27/06/2025, 14:33:12] Anton Christoff: BlackRock has issued even their own token ROCK on Ethereum
[27/06/2025, 14:34:01] Anton Christoff: And we could shape this in a cost efficient prototype version
[27/06/2025, 14:36:14] Anton Christoff: Ethereum network already has the biggest traction on integrations with other blockchains - as starting point for the prototype version, but overall offering should definitely be blockchain agnostics, as some firms might decide to jump into other networks at first
[27/06/2025, 14:38:49] Katie Lingley: Exactly
[02/07/2025, 23:58:36] Anton Christoff: https://cryptocrunchapp.com/cryptocrunchnews/latest-blackrock-earns-more-from-bitcoin-etf-fees-than-its-sp-fund/
[09/07/2025, 16:38:03] Katie Lingley: Hi Anton, how easy would it be to build a global on-chain recruitment and skills development platform? What cost too?
[10/07/2025, 20:37:38] Anton Christoff: Hi Katie,
I have to look at what’s already out there atm, and on which network. There has been an unsuccessful startup initiative for same use case within r3 back in the days, and they could not make any progress.
Cost pretty much depends on how much onchain stuff would happen and, who will bear the cost (the economics behind it, as decentralised models are completely new economic playgrounds, with liability and responsibility being shared across the network), and how much “web2” front end stuff we already have or we need to build.
In most ventures, biggest cost isn’t the emerging tech bit, but rather the good old fashioned digital transformation stuff… do we have website, platform, database, crm, erp, whatever the case system there might be running already, etc.
[10/07/2025, 20:57:50] Katie Lingley: That’s interesting, why was the R3 initiative unsuccessful? Hiring is not overly complex but I guess as you say others need to have access within the on-chain system to be part of it, which not everybody is as yet? I had thought there may already be someone doing it. It may be easier to build from scratch than transforming from a legacy system as thats outdated. Perhaps done in phases, as a really basic database and verification tool initially. I saw a company in US called thirdweb who have a plug and play build your own platform for blockchain developers, do you know them?
[10/07/2025, 20:58:24] Katie Lingley: thirdweb.com
[10/07/2025, 21:01:35] Katie Lingley: They secured $24M in Series A funding at a $160M valuation
[10/07/2025, 21:39:29] Katie Lingley: Am just thinking whether this type of hiring platform can run itself and generate income or fees whilst we build the main ETF value platform
[10/07/2025, 22:56:11] Anton Christoff: Let me think about it and do some proper research on models, solutions as I’m currently quite unaware of this particular space
[15/07/2025, 17:18:08] Katie Lingley: Hi Anton, I’ve checked online and it looks like it can be done in 4 weeks. Are you able to do this and let me know your fee please?

[22/07/2025, 15:36:01] Katie Lingley: Hi Anton, does any of this make sense to you?
[03/08/2025, 17:59:42] Anton Christoff: Hi Katie, excuse my radio silence but had to pull myself into fixing a business in distress type of urgency work until now
[03/08/2025, 18:00:18] Anton Christoff: The above is what the best in the market do atm
[03/08/2025, 18:00:55] Anton Christoff: And everything basically could be done, but we have to drill down to the func requirements and monetisation model
[03/08/2025, 18:01:12] Anton Christoff: I’m capable to lead a team to deliver any biz and tech transformation
[03/08/2025, 18:02:09] Anton Christoff: And we could find a feasible solution between ourselves for sure I think, to agree on a fee structure that suits us both
[03/08/2025, 18:02:34] Anton Christoff: I’m quite realistic in my expectations and don’t ask for market fees for ventures still in the making ‎<This message was edited>
[03/08/2025, 18:03:25] Anton Christoff: And prefer to find a workable solutions that would cover the basics from both sides in terms of my commitment
[03/08/2025, 18:04:10] Anton Christoff: If we could work together on drilling down the basics of what we’re aiming to achieve with whatever tech, we would have a successful endeavour ahead
[03/08/2025, 18:05:05] Anton Christoff: This include not only idea, but how this would start generating revenue and overall work efficiently, rather than dragging you down in fixed cost of running and maintaining something no one really interacts with
[03/08/2025, 18:05:27] Anton Christoff: That’s the main failure thus far with whatever tech we use in biz or social, from my 20y experience thus far doing the above ‎<This message was edited>
[03/08/2025, 18:05:43] Anton Christoff: And apologies if I might sound like a broken record to you
[03/08/2025, 18:07:36] Anton Christoff: But this is where success and failure meet, as overall good intentions and ideas are out there, but lacking the realistic hook that people would start using it takes things into the abyss. And that’s where we could possibly have future disturbances between our expectations and results
[03/08/2025, 18:08:17] Anton Christoff: Trying to be completely frank and fully transparent here, as the brain vomit above is coming from experience 🙏
[03/08/2025, 18:20:48] Katie Lingley: Absolutely, 100% understand
[03/08/2025, 18:21:26] Katie Lingley: There’s no point in building a platform that nobody interacts with and does not monetise
[03/08/2025, 18:22:00] Katie Lingley: We could get funding or VC backing but the ROI needs to be there and it needs to scale quickly globally
[03/08/2025, 18:22:49] Katie Lingley: These are the ideas from the financial services sector where there are gaps in the market but we definitely need interest
[03/08/2025, 18:23:55] Katie Lingley: Automating processes and trying to find the low hanging fruit to create something that is not too labour intensive is ideal
[03/08/2025, 18:24:04] Anton Christoff: And starting point might be these gaps in the market… if we evaluate where the wins from quick and dirty to biggest by fully spanned out platform would be
[03/08/2025, 18:24:27] Anton Christoff: Exactly… we need quick wins fast
[03/08/2025, 18:24:35] Katie Lingley: Yes that’s right
[03/08/2025, 18:24:45] Anton Christoff: Otherwise would get dragged down by perfecting something that no one’s know what it should be yet
[03/08/2025, 18:25:15] Katie Lingley: Absolutely, you are the expert so what have you seen that would work initially?
[03/08/2025, 18:26:31] Katie Lingley: Is there a blockchain skills scarcity to enable the building of platforms or are people going for a plug and play solution?
[03/08/2025, 18:29:36] Anton Christoff: The low hanging fruits in the market gap areas where processed and being either slowed down or dragged over the reasonable period due to manual/human related inefficiencies… basically all transformation work could be drilled down into the simple exercise, or let’s see where people and manual paper driven processes from the past fail, and start from there
[03/08/2025, 18:30:36] Anton Christoff: From a user stand point we should aim for simplicity and non blockchain presented solution, but something better, faster, more efficient and fair perhaps
[03/08/2025, 18:32:14] Anton Christoff: From a blockchain skillset perspective, we should first consider popularity and enhanced tech stack that would alllow us not only to build the to-be model (which is the easiest bit), but more importantly make it work with legacy tech stack that would make it successfully
[03/08/2025, 18:45:53] Katie Lingley: Would this not come down to a basic general ledger being automated? This would work across all businesses as a starting point
[03/08/2025, 18:46:17] Katie Lingley: Better, faster, fair?
[03/08/2025, 18:46:45] Anton Christoff: It key is how to monetise on it and split liability of overall run and maintenance of the ledger
[03/08/2025, 18:47:02] Anton Christoff: Direction where we could look at
[03/08/2025, 18:47:19] Katie Lingley: I don’t think building on top of legacy systems is efficient but would be a parallel run
[03/08/2025, 18:47:25] Anton Christoff: How to improve status quo by finding a better way of doing it through tech
[03/08/2025, 18:47:36] Anton Christoff: It’s the integration point
[03/08/2025, 18:47:41] Anton Christoff: Not building on top
[03/08/2025, 18:47:58] Anton Christoff: As you have to suck out data from legacy predominantly
[03/08/2025, 18:48:05] Katie Lingley: The GL is the starting point, then build product and efficiencies on top
[03/08/2025, 18:48:31] Katie Lingley: Is there an off the shelf solution?
[03/08/2025, 18:49:35] Katie Lingley: Yes it’s like any new system implementation, data migration and parallel run for 3 months before full integration and usage
[03/08/2025, 19:05:01] Anton Christoff: Usually use a well developed more centralised solution to capture and execute most of CRM related stuff and distribute this over a gl to all involved parties
[03/08/2025, 19:05:49] Katie Lingley: Some CRM’s are expensive though
[03/08/2025, 19:06:12] Anton Christoff: If we want to entire move things in chain, we should look deeper into the monetisation model, as you can imagine, the more data you capture over time through interactions between network peers, the more expensive things would get
[03/08/2025, 19:07:03] Anton Christoff: True that, but depending on func requirements we could find or use a template white label type of model to build ourselves
[03/08/2025, 19:08:46] Anton Christoff: And someone had to cover that bill which is almost all current cases of things running live is the organiser of the GL or network who basicallly run things on muscle until money dries out, which always comes first, if you have not found a low handing fruit to start fussing you with revenue as faster as possible
[03/08/2025, 19:09:36] Anton Christoff: Basically we need to find something both simple enough to get going, but also interesting enough to the market to start using it on the go
[03/08/2025, 19:11:47] Katie Lingley: Something people don’t realise is “blockchain” but is necessary for daily consumption
[03/08/2025, 19:12:20] Katie Lingley: Was this a success?
[03/08/2025, 19:19:03] Anton Christoff: So far, so good basically… we managed to create a short term plan which would start releasing working capital immediately and furthermore minimise as much as possible unnecessary running cost
[03/08/2025, 19:19:30] Anton Christoff: Personally, I think the term blockchain is a no go to when it comes to end users
[03/08/2025, 19:19:43] Anton Christoff: And most are still in the twilight zone of what this really is
[03/08/2025, 19:20:54] Anton Christoff: And if we market this purely as something advance tech or emerging tech enabled that would do things essentiall either better or faster in some way, it could start working… especially if we find some hook to suck and keep users in
[03/08/2025, 19:20:55] Katie Lingley: Yeah still a lot of uncertainty
[03/08/2025, 19:22:18] Katie Lingley: Nobody really knows if the tech is 100% trustworthy I suppose
[03/08/2025, 19:22:32] Katie Lingley: But ETH has been doing so well
[03/08/2025, 19:23:29] Anton Christoff: That’s why we don’t have to use it as a marketing phrase
[03/08/2025, 19:23:44] Anton Christoff: If someone wants to know in details, fair enough
[03/08/2025, 19:24:04] Anton Christoff: But not necessarily sticking the blockchain word upfront
[03/08/2025, 19:24:13] Katie Lingley: But UK are going full steam ahead with sand boxes
[03/08/2025, 19:24:21] Katie Lingley: So I think we should be good
[03/08/2025, 19:24:26] Anton Christoff: As it would rather bring more negative connotation
[03/08/2025, 19:25:08] Katie Lingley: As long as someone else ie govt approves it then fine
[03/08/2025, 19:25:25] Anton Christoff: Of course, that’s the only way to save the HOLY CITY OF LONDON WHICH INDEPENDENTLY WAS FINANCING THE shit show of this world for the past 1000y 🤡
[03/08/2025, 19:25:59] Anton Christoff: Fin services is a dying breed
[03/08/2025, 19:26:12] Katie Lingley: Absolutely, holding onto their egos 😂
[03/08/2025, 19:26:21] Anton Christoff: People are more and more informed how they are being robbed by everyone around them
[03/08/2025, 19:26:28] Katie Lingley: But we have to play nice
[03/08/2025, 19:26:41] Katie Lingley: For now 😊
[03/08/2025, 19:26:43] Anton Christoff: Of course
[03/08/2025, 19:26:52] Anton Christoff: The English way
[03/08/2025, 19:26:59] Katie Lingley: Indeed
[03/08/2025, 19:27:08] Anton Christoff: With their tools and attitude
[03/08/2025, 19:27:55] Katie Lingley: It’s protecting the complex structures and many of those benefitting from legacy
[03/08/2025, 19:28:10] Katie Lingley: Incl politics
[03/08/2025, 19:28:14] Katie Lingley: None of it needed
[03/08/2025, 19:30:17] Anton Christoff: 🙌
[03/08/2025, 19:31:17] Anton Christoff: Whatever would really work would suffice for me, if we manage to find a spot where we could drill a small hole, that would further turn into a $$$ opportunity
[27/08/2025, 09:13:28] Katie Lingley: Morning Anton, quick one in your previous experience, did you ever use a tool to assess the readiness of a company to adopt blockchain tokenization?
[27/08/2025, 10:24:28] Anton Christoff: Morning Katie
[27/08/2025, 10:24:49] Anton Christoff: There were some blockchain maturity models out there which we used back then
[27/08/2025, 10:25:11] Anton Christoff: But not strictly tokenisation related
[27/08/2025, 10:25:18] Anton Christoff: More overall models
[27/08/2025, 10:27:28] Anton Christoff: Haven’t checked what’s currently on the market in terms of latest stuff and models on the market, but I’m sure companies offering such services have most probably developed similar solutions
[27/08/2025, 11:49:55] Katie Lingley: Ok any idea who does this currently?
[27/08/2025, 13:33:11] Anton Christoff: Guessing everyone as this is one of the major prerequisite steps as you have to quantify effort, amount of work, etc
[27/08/2025, 13:33:25] Anton Christoff: Just not sure if there is a template version
[27/08/2025, 13:34:23] Anton Christoff: There are some global institutes out there which are trying to standardise the process - that’s what I meant by not knowing what’s the current status there as these take quite a long time to move things in any direction
[27/08/2025, 13:35:28] Anton Christoff: Otherwise, each and every company that does tokenisation (or at the proper ones on the market) is going through this assessment before actually start building stuff
[27/08/2025, 14:03:27] Katie Lingley: Maybe that could be designed as a standard template onchain to provide a visual? Would that be easy to do?
[27/08/2025, 14:13:56] Anton Christoff: That’s what all these organisations are aiming to agree on
[27/08/2025, 14:14:39] Anton Christoff: But at the moment I have not seen a standardised template available, but rather companies developing their own
[27/08/2025, 14:16:00] Anton Christoff: Meaning the company that we would decide to do the tech work for us would come up with their standard way to assess the as-is vs to-be models
[27/08/2025, 14:18:44] Katie Lingley: The new tech Defi guys don’t speak Tradfi so I think this would be a way to bridge if we can create that intermediary and funnel work to tech support
[27/08/2025, 14:19:46] Katie Lingley: Can we create something onchain to provide a heat map and roadmap or something?
[28/08/2025, 00:05:15] Anton Christoff: Can we possibly first fix the basics on what are we aiming to do here? Is this re your idea about an hr platform running on blockchain or an overall tokenomics one?
[28/08/2025, 00:06:25] Anton Christoff: If we agree and decide on where we would dig in deeper that it’d be easier to drill down on which are the best on the market and which to approach and contact
[28/08/2025, 07:53:49] Katie Lingley: Good morning, this is about the transition, the bridge that’s needed. It’s a basic tool which is rough and ready, rather than something too complex and over developed. It can be used for any industry. What are your thoughts?
[28/08/2025, 11:35:29] Anton Christoff: Good morning, just trying to get my head around this to understand it better.
Basically your idea is to create an online tool that could bridge the existing legacy TradeFi with the new emerging tech models right?
[28/08/2025, 12:07:45] Katie Lingley: Yes to provide an initial assessment of readiness and a roadmap forward, which we can use to engage the tech guys on their requirements, but it needs to be on-chain to be fast and efficient with a heat map of priorities for implementation
[28/08/2025, 12:08:33] Katie Lingley: Do you think this would work as an initial low cost tool?
[28/08/2025, 12:09:25] Anton Christoff: So kind of a maturity model available online with some sort of a questionnaire which would map the as-is model of a current org into the future to-be
[28/08/2025, 12:09:42] Anton Christoff: Definitely a clever approach
[28/08/2025, 12:09:54] Anton Christoff: And definitely worth digging in deeper
[28/08/2025, 12:09:59] Katie Lingley: Correct
[28/08/2025, 12:10:44] Katie Lingley: It would gather all info needed and create a database too for workflows
[28/08/2025, 12:11:18] Katie Lingley: How would we do this on-chain?
[28/08/2025, 12:11:51] Anton Christoff: I know that Chainlink for example are making some progress on that front in terms of solutions, as they seem to be on the forefront atm to all things enterprise blockchain, but also worth checking Nethermind as well as others to see which would be the most cost efficient solution for us
[28/08/2025, 12:12:18] Anton Christoff: Don’t necessarily think that we need this to be on chain
[28/08/2025, 12:12:43] Katie Lingley: Would they not just be providing their service and not really focusing on existing infrastructure?
[28/08/2025, 12:12:45] Anton Christoff: As it would incur more cost to run, manage, maintain, etc
[28/08/2025, 12:13:06] Katie Lingley: It would help for efficiency and showcase blockchain
[28/08/2025, 12:13:33] Katie Lingley: How much?
[28/08/2025, 12:13:58] Anton Christoff: Well, that’s currently the bottleneck - as all new solutions out are not quite well thought to when it comes to integrating with existing infrastructure
[28/08/2025, 12:14:27] Katie Lingley: Exactly, so this tool would help right?
[28/08/2025, 12:14:48] Anton Christoff: Surely it would help budge the gap between legacy and future tech
[28/08/2025, 12:14:54] Katie Lingley: Surely your previous firm had a way of assessing a client’s needs etc
[28/08/2025, 12:15:06] Katie Lingley: Absolutely
[28/08/2025, 12:16:18] Katie Lingley: Rather than building a whole overlay, it’s a tool to redirect towards the tech providers etc
[28/08/2025, 12:16:28] Katie Lingley: Of the clients choice really
[28/08/2025, 12:16:37] Anton Christoff: Don’t know exactly, but the idea to create a blockchain network is to link in a decentralised way many participants, who will interact with each other based on predefined rules, which would mean more cost for infrastructure
[28/08/2025, 12:16:42] Katie Lingley: Dependant on jurisdiction
[28/08/2025, 12:17:16] Katie Lingley: We can focus on tokenization only initially
[28/08/2025, 12:17:43] Anton Christoff: That’s fine, but still we do not have “this network” atm
[28/08/2025, 12:18:21] Anton Christoff: So might be better to rather create a more centralised platform of ours that could be the starting point
[28/08/2025, 12:18:26] Katie Lingley: The tool would create the network, my database is focused on financial services which is a starting point
[28/08/2025, 12:18:55] Anton Christoff: As ideally we want clients to assess their readiness with our help and then to further help/assist them in executing
[28/08/2025, 12:18:58] Katie Lingley: Ok so a blockchain platform
[28/08/2025, 12:19:58] Anton Christoff: Let’s call it blockchain enabled platform
[28/08/2025, 12:20:02] Katie Lingley: Yes tech providers would be linked as partnerships
[28/08/2025, 12:20:24] Katie Lingley: What’s the difference?
[28/08/2025, 12:20:27] Anton Christoff: When’re users could login and assess their readiness and based on outcomes the platform could direct/suggest solutions on way forward
[28/08/2025, 12:21:05] Anton Christoff: When we say blockchain platform we need to run things entirely on some blockchain network, which we really do not need right now
[28/08/2025, 12:21:14] Anton Christoff: We don’t have to have this at the start
[28/08/2025, 12:21:28] Katie Lingley: Correct and provide a confidential report for implementation
[28/08/2025, 12:21:47] Anton Christoff: Every single interaction there would incur unnecessary  cost
[28/08/2025, 12:22:10] Anton Christoff: This is another reason why we need this centralised
[28/08/2025, 12:22:11] Katie Lingley: Why not?
[28/08/2025, 12:22:36] Katie Lingley: I need to understand these costs
[28/08/2025, 12:22:45] Anton Christoff: Let me explain this differently
[28/08/2025, 12:24:00] Anton Christoff: Currently we do not know who else might be interested to join such a network, meaning that right now we could create a solution with only ourselves in there - meaning a network of one only
[28/08/2025, 12:24:37] Anton Christoff: A centralised platform with bridges to decentralised networks would definitely work better
[28/08/2025, 12:24:50] Anton Christoff: As ideally we’d like to monetise on this
[28/08/2025, 12:25:43] Anton Christoff: A branded platform that could further be used as a bridge to whatever the blockchain solution us and client agree to use for implementation
[28/08/2025, 12:26:16] Anton Christoff: Maybe we could sit together for some time to define the basics of this platform in a simple doc
[28/08/2025, 12:26:49] Anton Christoff: And then use this for further discussions with the blockchain guys out there to see which would be best for us in terms of cost and features
[28/08/2025, 12:28:29] Anton Christoff: You have a database already and an emerging tech enabled centralised platform makes much more sense for me, as it would be easier to integrate with everything else as starting point
Then we could always create and run this in a blockchain network
[28/08/2025, 12:30:24] Anton Christoff: Most of solutions out there incur greater cost not on the blockchain build side, but rather the front end bit which is classic old-school dev work - portals, websites that takes time and money
[28/08/2025, 12:32:11] Katie Lingley: I’ve just Googled “emerging tech enabled centralised platform”…looks good, thought blockchain would be cheaper but if it needs a front end old school UX element then fine
[28/08/2025, 12:32:32] Katie Lingley: What does this cost?
[28/08/2025, 12:32:42] Katie Lingley: Thought money was in owning the tech
[28/08/2025, 12:37:06] Anton Christoff: Based on previous projects the old-school stuff was more or less at least 50% of the cost - in some cases it was even 2/3 of the cost
[28/08/2025, 12:37:55] Anton Christoff: That’s the idea of the branded platform as we’d like these clients to pay us to assess their readiness and not doing it for free as this is the value add service that we’d offer essentially
[28/08/2025, 12:38:46] Anton Christoff: Everyone thinks that we run on a perfect web3 world which isn’t the case unfortunately, and most of current solutions are really not meant to be integrated with anything really
[28/08/2025, 12:38:59] Anton Christoff: The current web2 world is a mess
[28/08/2025, 12:39:08] Anton Christoff: With solutions working in silos
[28/08/2025, 12:40:06] Anton Christoff: Most of my work in tech has been to integrate solutions that are not meant to integrate with anything
[28/08/2025, 12:40:28] Katie Lingley: I think an initial questionnaire could triage and funnel readiness and we then set up an in person consultation for those needing more in depth discussion with project fees, or are you thinking a tiered pricing approach per size of organisation and everything is done online?
[28/08/2025, 12:41:08] Anton Christoff: As this is the Web2 standard on the market - my solution is best and I’m not going to make it easier to integrate with anything else
[28/08/2025, 12:42:21] Anton Christoff: Maybe a bit of both - what do you think? As it would not make sense to treat in the same way a big company with lots of complexities with a small one that almost has none
[28/08/2025, 12:42:27] Katie Lingley: OK well we are not providing the tokenization service as such
[28/08/2025, 12:44:17] Katie Lingley: Exactly, happy to consult to larger global firms in London / EU and provide in person discussions with solutions but an initial comprehensive professional report would be the starting point
[28/08/2025, 12:46:03] Katie Lingley: There will be smaller players who will be able to connect to the tech guys and we get a retainer + % aum or something, like a tech sales structure
[28/08/2025, 12:47:53] Katie Lingley: Our partnerships need to be confidential though and list not accessible to the general public or easy to replicate, we cannot take on the risk of making a recommendation and it fails, the client needs to make their own decision regarding provider but an outline of roadmap is key
[28/08/2025, 12:52:48] Katie Lingley: In finance, the key aspects are regulatory framework, international policy alignment and trade barriers
[28/08/2025, 13:08:23] Katie Lingley: When would you like to do this? I will need to understand timeframe and costs etc
[28/08/2025, 15:52:22] Anton Christoff: https://www.pymnts.com/partnerships/2025/google-cloud-and-cme-group-pilot-distributed-ledger-for-trading/
[28/08/2025, 15:59:30] Katie Lingley: Is this the route you want to go?
[28/08/2025, 16:36:44] Anton Christoff: my preferred route has always been tech agnostic as I’d like flexibility and freedom to choose with whom to play with 🙂
[28/08/2025, 16:37:40] Anton Christoff: I was waiting for you to get back to me with time and availability to start shaping things as previously discussed in a simple form
[28/08/2025, 16:41:20] Anton Christoff: if we find time to shape the basics of our idea into somewhat of a framework requirements doc, then we could easily share and discuss with techies
[28/08/2025, 16:42:34] Anton Christoff: nethermind were waiting for this since end of last year when we started talking, so it’d be nice if we can start between ourselves first into shaping pure non-tech doc
[28/08/2025, 16:43:28] Anton Christoff: what and how we’d like to have
[28/08/2025, 16:44:08] Katie Lingley: This solution is new and needs to be tech agnostic as you say, it will be up to the user to decide which tech provider to engage with, the partnerships would need to be added secondary after we have established the platform
[28/08/2025, 16:44:53] Katie Lingley: Can we set up a basis rough and ready platform first and gauge interest as we onboard users and partners?
[28/08/2025, 16:45:21] Anton Christoff: can we set up the basics of this platform in a doc first?
[28/08/2025, 16:45:30] Anton Christoff: always good to jot down the basics
[28/08/2025, 16:45:37] Anton Christoff: which we can further work on
[28/08/2025, 16:45:50] Anton Christoff: it could be bullet points
[28/08/2025, 16:45:55] Anton Christoff: or even notes
[28/08/2025, 16:45:59] Katie Lingley: Ok what format?
[28/08/2025, 16:46:05] Anton Christoff: does not matter
[28/08/2025, 16:46:14] Anton Christoff: whatever we decide to use
[28/08/2025, 16:46:21] Anton Christoff: perhaps if you could start from your side
[28/08/2025, 16:46:21] Katie Lingley: Based on what we’ve chatted about above, is this logical and workable
[28/08/2025, 16:46:33] Katie Lingley: Is it something you want to do?
[28/08/2025, 16:46:56] Anton Christoff: with scribing the idea on how you see it - and then we could polish it further together
[28/08/2025, 16:47:34] Katie Lingley: It would be exactly per notes above
[28/08/2025, 16:47:41] Anton Christoff: don’t have to be a detailed doc right now
[28/08/2025, 16:47:46] Katie Lingley: I need to know costs and timeframe from you roughly
[28/08/2025, 16:48:25] Anton Christoff: yeah, but when you write it down you may have a new idea or a clearer one, which I could then take and expand
[28/08/2025, 16:48:47] Katie Lingley: We need it very simple to start with and build from there as we generate more income
[28/08/2025, 16:49:10] Anton Christoff: I don’t know these by heart - that’s why i like us to have this in a doc, which we could share across for evaluation
[28/08/2025, 16:49:26] Katie Lingley: The automated report is key with the right questions, that is the starting point to predict readiness
[28/08/2025, 16:49:49] Anton Christoff: can you do this in a doc with bullet points?
[28/08/2025, 16:49:52] Katie Lingley: Estimated range?
[28/08/2025, 16:50:56] Anton Christoff: from 25k to 250k
[28/08/2025, 16:51:47] Anton Christoff: I have an idea for a decentralised crowdfunding platform and when I shared this with a tech company for evaluation - they came up with 250k build
[28/08/2025, 16:51:52] Anton Christoff: for 6 months
[28/08/2025, 16:52:01] Anton Christoff: and most of money and work were web2 related
[28/08/2025, 16:52:12] Anton Christoff: websites, UI/UX, etc. ‎<This message was edited>
[28/08/2025, 16:52:39] Anton Christoff: 4 months worth of build, whilst the blockchain bit was 1.5-2months
[28/08/2025, 16:52:46] Anton Christoff: just to give you an example
[28/08/2025, 16:53:06] Anton Christoff: that’s why I think the best way to do this is as I suggested
[28/08/2025, 16:53:47] Anton Christoff: first to brainstorm and get the idea on paper - from the basic and minimum viable version to the fully scaled one
[28/08/2025, 16:53:47] Katie Lingley: This is not as complex surely
[28/08/2025, 16:54:04] Anton Christoff: not complex but time and money consuming
[28/08/2025, 16:54:19] Anton Christoff: which if not thought well, would be money for nothing
[28/08/2025, 16:54:31] Katie Lingley: So it needs a full time developer?
[28/08/2025, 16:54:45] Anton Christoff: and this was the assessment for the first propotype version
[28/08/2025, 16:55:06] Katie Lingley: Ok but that’s running big money through it
[28/08/2025, 16:55:06] Anton Christoff: at least one
[28/08/2025, 16:55:17] Katie Lingley: Who would you suggest?
[28/08/2025, 16:56:00] Anton Christoff: 👆this and this… same for every other idea taken from reality into the virtual space
[28/08/2025, 16:56:47] Katie Lingley: Ok but would you do the work or get someone else to do it?
[28/08/2025, 17:03:16] Anton Christoff: that entirely depends on how I’d be involved in this endeavour Katie… or in other words how you see me being involved in this
[28/08/2025, 17:03:29] Anton Christoff: perhaps let’s park here
[28/08/2025, 17:04:24] Anton Christoff: maybe you could think about locking the desired solution first in a paper - and then see what would comes as a solutions our of it and how it could be done
[28/08/2025, 17:04:25] Katie Lingley: Yeah just trying to understand the skills needed and the capacity you have right now etc
[28/08/2025, 17:05:04] Anton Christoff: building tech - no matter what type is same with each and every solutions
[28/08/2025, 17:05:15] Anton Christoff: same mix of skills and expertise
[28/08/2025, 17:05:50] Katie Lingley: I don’t have all the tech answers to put into a doc with exactly how it will be done
[28/08/2025, 17:06:04] Anton Christoff: my capacity depends on what’s in it for me frankly speaking
[28/08/2025, 17:06:12] Katie Lingley: That’s where I was hoping you could help
[28/08/2025, 17:06:13] Anton Christoff: we do not need tech here
[28/08/2025, 17:06:21] Anton Christoff: just plain and simple english
[28/08/2025, 17:06:36] Anton Christoff: as I still need to see if I do understand it as well
[28/08/2025, 17:06:51] Anton Christoff: comparing the pages first to align between ourselves
[28/08/2025, 17:07:05] Anton Christoff: to get on the same one which is a crucial step 1
[28/08/2025, 17:07:29] Katie Lingley: Yeah sure and what or how would you design it so that it’s 80% automated and generating income from day 1
[28/08/2025, 17:08:29] Katie Lingley: If you don’t see potential in it then I wouldn’t want to bore you lol
[28/08/2025, 17:08:41] Katie Lingley: It needs to be exciting for you
[28/08/2025, 17:08:48] Anton Christoff: if we get the idea on a napkin as they say, then we could move on quite fast together on expanding this doc into a more comprehensive solution doc
[28/08/2025, 17:08:48] Katie Lingley: Otherwise no point
[28/08/2025, 17:09:15] Anton Christoff: if I did not see this I’d not be discussing things with you now 🙂
[28/08/2025, 17:10:02] Katie Lingley: Give me a layout and I’ll input what you need
[28/08/2025, 17:10:17] Anton Christoff: with the help of all these “AI” tools, things are getting more and more automated anyhow
[28/08/2025, 17:10:28] Katie Lingley: With tech partners, it can generate from day 1
[28/08/2025, 17:11:37] Katie Lingley: This seems to make the most sense
[28/08/2025, 17:11:48] Anton Christoff: plain doc file with sequence and bullet points to further add context:
1. 
-
-
2.
and you should entirely use your language as you see this in your head
[28/08/2025, 17:12:13] Anton Christoff: i think this is the most sensible way to approach things right now
[28/08/2025, 17:12:26] Katie Lingley: Sequence? Workflow process
[28/08/2025, 17:12:39] Anton Christoff: as building something energing tech enabled means in simple english - just using tech stacks and tools that are new
[28/08/2025, 17:13:54] Anton Christoff: no no… just I’d like 1. to have this and that, ideally with:
- this into consideration;
- ⁠that in mind
then 2. this should whatever by:
- …
[28/08/2025, 17:13:59] Anton Christoff: as simple as possible
[28/08/2025, 17:14:07] Anton Christoff: no formats or complications
[28/08/2025, 17:14:17] Anton Christoff: just describing how you see the idea in your head
[28/08/2025, 17:14:57] Anton Christoff: and if possible share as much as possible details you might have in mind, or if unsure just mention it - TBD/TBC
[28/08/2025, 17:15:30] Anton Christoff: sounds stupid and childish, but trust me - this was the thing that made all successful digital endeavours reality
[28/08/2025, 17:15:44] Anton Christoff: as on the back of this - everything else could be build
[28/08/2025, 17:16:11] Anton Christoff: we need the non-tech logic captured somewhere in a clear concise form
[28/08/2025, 17:16:38] Anton Christoff: just as text - rest is easy as everything else would follow this doc
[28/08/2025, 17:17:50] Anton Christoff: and please - do not think about tech at all… apart from the willingness to have a tech tool that could do 1.2.3.
[28/08/2025, 17:44:37] Katie Lingley: Should we get on a 30min call tomorrow and I’ll explain, you can jot down notes to get the idea?
[28/08/2025, 20:12:49] Anton Christoff: If you do not mind, I’d still prefer for you to first capture the idea by yourself and send over for me to look and then to jump on a call to fix things and decide on way forward
[28/08/2025, 20:17:31] Katie Lingley: I’ve captured it in a lot of detail so am trying to work through it myself and determine any obstacles ie data compliance etc with the outcomes needed
[28/08/2025, 20:19:49] Katie Lingley: It’s the building skills I need and for someone to simplify implementation
[28/08/2025, 20:20:42] Katie Lingley: Have you dealt with a RegTech platform before? It would be similar
[28/08/2025, 23:25:22] Anton Christoff: https://x.com/watcherguru/status/1961065495920017723?s=48&t=bXUEPmdmiIzDKzGkWXDG6g
[28/08/2025, 23:27:18] Anton Christoff: I did in the past within kpmg and infosys
[28/08/2025, 23:27:59] Anton Christoff: Stick to only the plain biz side of things and we will work all the details further
‎[29/08/2025, 12:31:57] Katie Lingley: ‎image omitted
[29/08/2025, 12:55:17] Anton Christoff: It’s just the warm up before the beginning of it
[29/08/2025, 12:56:23] Anton Christoff: Everything with value that is moving electronically will be tokenised on a distributed ledger tech in the next 5years I think
[29/08/2025, 13:04:52] Katie Lingley: Correct, so now is the time to support with that transition. The T+1 deadline in the UK is October 2027. Only 2 years!
[29/08/2025, 14:14:42] Anton Christoff: U.K. will most probably accelerate this initiative in order to save the city’s FS status, same as for the US
[03/09/2025, 22:40:50] Anton Christoff: Did you manage to jot down the idea to share it with me? Things seems starting to escalate with marketing announcements popping up on daily basis. W’d be on the forefront and much better positioned if we use the bull run momentum before end of this year to get something out and about
[04/09/2025, 07:14:45] Katie Lingley: Hi Anton, I agree but it’s extremely complex so am trying to formulate the best & quickest way to build
[04/09/2025, 09:33:08] Anton Christoff: Let’s stick to your core business requirements/principles to draw a map at high level first. Then, it’d be easier to have a call and fill as much as possible info together
[04/09/2025, 09:49:57] Katie Lingley: This isn’t easy at all, it’s like tweaking a massive engine, one part tweaked and it impacts something else so am trying to get my head around it all without having to explain every single intricate part
[30/09/2025, 14:26:52] Anton Christoff: Hi Katie, how are things going with you, and did you have the time to think about our endeavour? It’d be great to get our hands dirty, as I’m quite into the rabbit hole of emerging tech and messing blockchain with AI. If you can send me at least a draft for review and then build a model for it and our positions inside, we’d be quite on the forefront of the big wave coming
[30/09/2025, 17:33:37] Katie Lingley: Hi Anton, there have been plenty of developments in the regulated space recently so just trying to rethink and include that in my minds eye. Would be interested to hear what you’ve been working on?
[30/09/2025, 19:10:50] Anton Christoff: My passions still is on the edge of emerging tech and new sustainable models
[30/09/2025, 19:11:31] Anton Christoff: That’s why I believe we can build something from this platform
[30/09/2025, 19:11:52] Anton Christoff: Digital-fabrica.com
[30/09/2025, 19:13:29] Anton Christoff: Is the sci-fi end of the things in my head, which were developed alongside a friend of mine, on the back of years of exploration in new more future proof decentralised mechanisms
‎[30/09/2025, 19:21:42] Anton Christoff: ‎video omitted
‎[30/09/2025, 19:21:57] Anton Christoff: ‎video omitted
[30/09/2025, 19:53:09] Anton Christoff: Might have found a way to accelerate time from ideas into prototyping design/early stage alpha & beta tech stacks dev from 6-12m usually into 3-6months tops with AI automation
‎[30/09/2025, 19:55:18] Anton Christoff: stitchia_protocol_landing_preview.html ‎document omitted
[30/09/2025, 19:59:13] Katie Lingley: OK I’ll need to look at all of this and process it, my brain is too tired from today so tomorrow is better
[30/09/2025, 19:59:41] Katie Lingley: But yes, we spoke about the trust layer before so it will just be about how to commercialise that
[30/09/2025, 19:59:43] Anton Christoff: Leave these crazy parts for pleasure time :)
[30/09/2025, 20:00:22] Anton Christoff: See if you can create a draft with just the necessary basics
[30/09/2025, 20:00:26] Katie Lingley: Connecting and verifying the fragmented infrastructure is a huge task
[30/09/2025, 20:00:49] Katie Lingley: I have a high level doc but it always leads to more questions 😂
[30/09/2025, 20:08:35] Anton Christoff: we just have dreams of how everything and everyone can exist in connectivity one step at a time 🙂 rest would rush to catch up
[30/09/2025, 20:09:01] Anton Christoff: please don’t go there… let’s start with the high level stuff first
[30/09/2025, 20:17:34] Katie Lingley: Well even when I find supporting case study literature and proof of concept publications there’s still so many questions
[30/09/2025, 20:18:56] Katie Lingley: We just may not have all the answers that an investor would need
[30/09/2025, 21:37:01] Anton Christoff: That would entirely depend on how we unfold this
[30/09/2025, 21:37:16] Anton Christoff: Never too big of a bite at once
