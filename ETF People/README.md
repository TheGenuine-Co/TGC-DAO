# ETF People

This workspace tracks the ETF People initiative within TheGenuine Collective (TGC).

## Structure

- `docs/` — research briefs, governance charters, and meeting notes.
- `src/` — scripts or prototypes supporting ETF People operations.
- `assets/` — logos, design elements, and presentation collateral.
- `data/` — curated datasets and exports (keep sensitive data encrypted).

## Getting Started

1. Capture requirements in `docs/roadmap.md`.
2. Add working files under the relevant directory.
3. Commit changes frequently and sync with the TGC DAO repository as needed.

## Next Steps

- Define initial objectives for the ETF People program.
- Outline stakeholder roles and communication cadence.
- Gather reference materials to populate the `docs/` directory.
