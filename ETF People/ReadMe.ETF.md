# TheGenuine Collective DAO (TGC-DAO)       

## TheGenuine Collective (TGC) is a new form of business organisation that aims to provide a platform for businesses to collaborate and thrive collectively along with their customers and suppliers.

## Despite the current centralised state and physical organisation anchoring the entire venture, TGC aims to elevate the governance structure of the business to a decentralised model, once the foundation platform is launched.

## TGC would establish a DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation)that would be built and run transparently, and governed by its members, who are also the shareholders of the company.

2. Scope
- Strategy, product/tech due diligence, venture advisory, governance design, protocol alignment, and cross-domain integration.
