# Press Room â€” TheGenuine Collective

Purpose
- Workspace for Dia Ressini and collaborators to research, draft, and publish independent journalism under TGC-DAO.

Structure
- notes/: working research notes, interviews, outlines
- sources/: datasets, links, PDFs (public or with metadata only)
- drafts/: WIP drafts and revisions
- publishing/: final markdown, assets, and publication metadata

Interop with Digital Fabrica
- To register a document as a scroll for audit/braids, copy or author it in the Fabrica repo and run:
  - `./quantum process vault/documents/<file>.md`
- Or include this directory in the watch loop so updates auto-register.

Conventions
- Use frontmatter in drafts destined for registry (title, tags, links, license)
- Prefer primary sources; track citations in endnotes
- Avoid sensitive personal data unless explicit consent and necessity
